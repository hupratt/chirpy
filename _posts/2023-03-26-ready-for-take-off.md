## Prologue

Yet another technical blog. Does the world need another one of those, really? Isn't that just a fad from the  2000's that got away now that we have RSS, Medium or Wordpress? Most tech blogs usually get into such advanced topics right away that you might even be tempted to think that this whole exercise might just be a way to show off and please the company or the boss he or she is working for.
Those are all valid points and in a world where Chat GPT will help boost the amount of 'noise' already out there I don't blame you for thinking that way.
The truth is that I've been yearning to write down my thoughts and just never found the time to do so. We live in a constant fear of missing out on what others are doing on Instagram and Tiktok. At work our bosses create artificial deadlines to "motivate us" and to keep us in a state of perpetual race and competition against each other. 


This blog is not another one of those "paid partnership" or money funneling madness that you see out there on youtube either. Everything I do, the tools I use or the choices I make are entirely motivated by my decision to use those tools. 

After 7 years of so-called consulting I've had enough of this and decided to quit my job, quit social media and reconnect with the earthy pleasure of developing interesting projects for myself and cooking slow food. Thanks to this change I have re gained the energy and passion I thought I had lost for this unappreciated art we all call programming.

## A new beginning

Judging by blog's unpopularity with google this blog will probably not be read by anyone else than me or my close friends and family but I am comitting to writing on it at least once a week. Not because I need to attain fame or be seen but simply because time flies and if I don't start writing things down I will surely forget all about them in a couple of years. Call it a blog or a distributed diary I don't care. This moment of creation and creativity helps me reconnect with myself, explore my thoughts and above all else: satisfaction.

My moto has always been "show me the code" because I am a direct and not a politically correct person. I also don't fear being ridiculed or hated for what I say so I can be considered rude by most people. On and all, if the idea of listening to a grumpy old man has not dettered you stick around and I'll show you what I do, how to get started and what how you can apply code to build things.
